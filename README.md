# QR Code Augmented Reality 
Usage of [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) library of JavaScript to create an AR environment, enabling 3D objects to appear in QR Codes.
>Note: This is **Work In Progress**, so there are minor bugs and a few features only.

## Markers
I used [this](https://au.gmented.com/app/marker/marker.php) AR marker generator to create 3x3 QR Codes in range of 0 to 63 (total of 64) different patterns.

## 3D Models
To facilitate the process of creating and importing 3D objetcs in **.obj** format, I used the Autodesk [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).
